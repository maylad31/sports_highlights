# sports_highlights

I wanted to try and see if I could use gemini to generate highlights.

This is what this code does:

- Takes transcript of a sports game 

- Uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to pick the top 20 most important moments

- Cuts the video based on those moments and stitches them into a highlight reel.

It is still a work in progress, a lot of things can be improved and tried...
